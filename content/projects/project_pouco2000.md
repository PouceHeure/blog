This personal project aimed to simplify the creation of a physical module for interacting with and debugging robots using ROS.

The core idea was to provide libraries and packages that enable easy construction of a customizable physical control table.

I developed ROS-side packages to facilitate interfacing, along with an Arduino library to simplify the definition and use of I/O components.

The entire project was developed in C++.
