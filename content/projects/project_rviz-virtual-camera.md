## Overview

RViz2 is a visualization tool in ROS 2, widely used for debugging and introspecting robot data streams. While it supports visualizing camera feeds, markers, and 3D data, it lacks native functionality to **publish** rendered views as image topics, particularly from custom or fixed virtual viewpoints.

This limitation makes it difficult to:
- Capture high-quality visualizations for later review
- Generate consistent visual data for testing
- Stream synthetic camera views over the network

## Motivation

The ability to capture a specific rendered perspective is useful for many robotics tasks:
- Generating dataset frames from simulation
- Debugging perception algorithms
- Recording reproducible visualizations
- Creating visual outputs for reports or demos

Instead of relying on manual screen recording or external capture tools, a more integrated and programmatic solution was needed.

## Proposed Solution

To address this, I developed a **custom RViz2 plugin** that adds a virtual camera into the RViz rendering pipeline. This virtual camera acts as a ROS 2 image publisher, providing live snapshots of the scene from a configurable point of view.

{{< figure src="/images/rviz-virtual-camera/rviz_virtual_camera.png" caption="Screenshot example: Left - RViz2 view; Right - rqt_image_view displaying the virtual camera feed." width="500">}}

This plugin enables users to record and analyze rendered perspectives without needing to manually screen capture or replicate views.

## Features

The virtual camera plugin supports a variety of configurable parameters to adapt to different use cases:

- **Camera Name**: Custom name for topic and identification
- **Attached Frame**: TF frame the camera is bound to (e.g., `/map`, `/base_link`)
- **Field of View**: Horizontal field of view (in degrees)
- **Clipping Planes**: Near and far clip distances for rendering
- **Background Color**: Set background to match scene requirements
- **Image Resolution**: Width and height of the rendered output

These settings can be adjusted dynamically within RViz, and the plugin can be easily integrated into existing RViz configurations or launch files.

## Applications

This plugin is particularly useful for:

- **Simulation pipelines**: Capture synthetic sensor data from Gazebo or other simulated environments.
- **Testing and debugging**: Monitor specific visual perspectives without physical cameras.
- **Offline video generation**: Render visualizations from logs or bag files in a reproducible manner.
- **Educational content**: Record consistent viewports for tutorials and presentations.


## Conclusion

The RViz2 Virtual Camera plugin extends the standard visualization capabilities of ROS 2 by offering a way to publish high-quality, configurable image streams directly from the 3D rendered scene. This tool simplifies debugging, demo creation, and data generation, and opens the door to richer, programmatic use of RViz.
