## Overview

This project is a bicycle theft detection system based on the Sigfox network. It uses an Arduino board combined with an inertial measurement unit (IMU). When abnormal motion is detected, such as acceleration above a set threshold, the device sends data via Sigfox. The information is then forwarded to Firebase, which triggers a notification to the userâ€™s mobile application.

## Hardware

The device is built around an Arduino MKR FOX 1200, enabling Sigfox communication. An IMU board measures acceleration. LEDs are included to indicate status and assist during testing.

## Android Application

Developed in Java with Android Studio, the app allows users to register devices, view data received through Sigfox, and receive alerts via Firebase.

## System Workflow

1. The IMU continuously monitors acceleration. If it exceeds a predefined threshold, the event is classified as a theft attempt.  
2. A Sigfox frame is sent to the network. The Sigfox backend forwards the data to Firebase.  
3. Firebase pushes a notification to the Android app, alerting the user.  

The {{< videoref label="demo-lovo" >}} demonstrates this process in action.
