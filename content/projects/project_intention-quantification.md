## Abstract

In the context of shared control between an autonomous driving system and a human driver, evaluating the **quality** of driving intentions becomes critical. A **driving intention** is defined as a short sequence of planned control actions (speed, steering) over a time horizon.

{{< equation >}}
I_t = \{(v,w)_{t+0\cdot\Delta t},(v,w)_{t+1\cdot\Delta t},...,(v,w)_{t+n\cdot\Delta t}\}
{{< /equation >}}

For example an intention can be defined as a sequence of linear and angular velocities applied to the vehicle.

The challenge is twofold:

- Determine whether an intention is **admissible** (safe, legal, feasible)
- Evaluate its **quality** based on criteria like comfort, safety margin, and compliance with road constraints

This work introduces a quantification framework inspired by the Bellman principle, where a future-aware score is computed using **discounted weighted evaluations**.

The results were published at IEEE IV 2023, {{<cite GeneralHPousseur>}}

## Motivation

Driving intentions are often ambiguous. For the same situation, multiple trajectories may exist:

- One that crashes (inadmissible)
- One that narrowly avoids an obstacle (admissible but low quality)
- One that handles the scene smoothly (admissible and high quality)

## Unified Evaluation Pipeline

Each driving intention is evaluated over time and across multiple criteria using a **unified scoring formulation** that distinguishes between:

- **Admissibility**: binary decision from hard constraints (guards)
- **Quality**: scalar score using weighted and discounted evaluators


## Quality Evaluation (Soft Criteria)

Quality represents the evaluation of intentions based on several criteria, such as comfort and security. Each criterion is defined by two functions: a metric that quantifies the situation, and an analyzer that evaluates the result.

### Metric per Evaluator

For each soft evaluator $k$ and time step $t$, we compute a **metric**:

{{< equation >}}
m_k(t) = f_k(x_t, u_t, \text{context})
{{< /equation >}}

Where:
- $x_t$: system state at time $t$ (e.g. position, velocity)
- $u_t$: control command at time $t$ (e.g. acceleration, steering)
- `context`: environment description (obstacles, road structure)
- $f_k$: metric function for evaluator $k$ (e.g. lateral acceleration, speed violation)

### Analyzer Function (Generic Form)

Each metric is transformed into a **normalized score** using a dedicated analyzer function:

{{< equation >}}
q_k(t) = \mathcal{A}_k(m_k(t)) \in [0, 1]
{{< /equation >}}

Where:
- $\mathcal{A}_k$: a generic mapping that interprets the metric's value for comfort, safety, or feasibility.
- Example (sigmoid-shaped analyzer):

{{< equation >}}
\mathcal{A}_k(m) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{\text{ramp}_k \cdot (m - \text{shift}_k)}}
{{< /equation >}}

- `ramp_k`: controls the steepness of the score drop
- `shift_k`: defines the acceptable threshold

{{< figure src="/images/quantification-intentions/plot_acc_example_vert.png" caption="Example analyzer for lateral acceleration using sigmoid shape." width="500">}}

### Temporal Discounting

To give more weight to early decisions (e.g. avoid imminent risks), we apply exponential discounting:

{{< equation >}}
Q_k = \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t \cdot q_k(t)
{{< /equation >}}

Where:
- $Q_k$: total discounted score for evaluator $k$ 
- $q_k(t)$: score at time $t$ for evaluator $k$
- $\gamma$: discount factor $(\gamma \in [0, 1])$
- $T$: prediction horizon

{{< figure src="/images/quantification-intentions/implement_discount_factor.png" caption="Bellman-style discount accumulation gives more importance to short-term outcomes." width="500">}}

## Aggregation of Soft Scores

After computing all evaluator scores $Q_k$, we compute a final global score:

{{< equation >}}
Q_{\text{final}} = \sum_{k=1}^K w_k \cdot Q_k
{{< /equation >}}

Where:
- $w_k$: weight of importance for criterion $k$
- $Q_k$: quality score for criterion $k$

This fusion supports multi-objective comparison of **only admissible intentions**.


## Admissibility Evaluation (Hard Constraints)

Unlike soft evaluators, **admissibility** is a binary outcome either the intention is valid or not. It is determined by a set of **guard functions**.

Each guard combines:
- a metric function $m_j(t)$
- a boolean test $\mathcal{G}_j$ over that metric

The generic formulation for one guard is:

{{< equation >}}
g_j(t) = \mathcal{G}_j(m_j(t)) \in \{0, 1\}
{{< /equation >}}

And the final admissibility is:

{{< equation >}}
\text{Admissible} = \prod_j \left( \bigwedge_{t=0}^{T} g_j(t) \right)
{{< /equation >}}

This means:
- An intention is admissible **only if** all guards are satisfied at all time steps.
- If any guard fails, the intention is immediately rejected.

## Visualization of Evaluators

{{< figure src="/images/quantification-intentions/collision_front_avoid/plots/evaluators.png" caption="Evaluator visualization from a specific simulation test case (Set A): three criteria shown (collision, lateral acceleration, speed). Each row shows the metric, its analyzer output, the raw score, and final discounted score." width="850">}}

This figure comes from a scenario where the vehicle narrowly avoids a front obstacle with aggressive lateral acceleration.  
It illustrates how each step of the evaluation pipeline contributes to the global quality score.


## Trajectory Comparison

We now illustrate how the quantification framework evaluates three different driving intentions for the same scenario. The vehicle must navigate around a static obstacle ahead, with multiple trajectories generated.

### Environment Overview

{{< subfigure images="/images/quantification-intentions/collision_front_avoid/plots/states_env.png,/images/quantification-intentions/collision_front_hit/plots/states_env.png,/images/quantification-intentions/good/plots/states_env.png" captions="Set A: avoids with sharp maneuver, Set B: direct collision, Set C: safe and smooth path" >}}

- **Set A**: The trajectory performs a fast lateral deviation to avoid the obstacle, maintaining admissibility but causing strong accelerations.
- **Set B**: The vehicle continues straight and hits the obstacle it is flagged as inadmissible.
- **Set C**: The trajectory anticipates early, gently deviating from the obstacle with minimal dynamic effort.



### Per-Evaluator Score Analysis

Each trajectory is scored across three soft evaluators:

1. **Lateral acceleration** (comfort)
2. **Speed compliance** (respect for speed limits)
3. **Other contextual metrics** (but not collision itself)

{{< subfigure images="/images/quantification-intentions/collision_front_avoid/plots/scores.png,/images/quantification-intentions/collision_front_hit/plots/scores.png,/images/quantification-intentions/good/plots/scores.png" captions="Set A: evaluator scores, Set B: evaluator scores, Set C: evaluator scores" >}}

- **Set A** shows good obstacle clearance, but exhibits high lateral acceleration resulting in mixed score levels.
- **Set B** shows high comfort and speed compliance since the metrics are not aware of the collision but is ultimately **inadmissible**.
- **Set C** achieves high scores on all criteria, representing a smooth and legal behavior.



### Final Aggregated Score

The per-evaluator scores are combined using weighted summation into a **final quality score**, only for **admissible trajectories**:

{{< subfigure images="/images/quantification-intentions/collision_front_avoid/plots/article_qualities.png,/images/quantification-intentions/collision_front_hit/plots/article_qualities.png,/images/quantification-intentions/good/plots/article_qualities.png" captions="Set A: final score, Set B: final score (not used), Set C: final score" >}}

- **Set A** obtains a **moderate total score**. It is admissible but dynamically aggressive.
- **Set B** is **rejected** and not scored due to guard violation (despite high comfort scores).
- **Set C** receives the **highest final score**, reflecting a safe, smooth, and legal trajectory.


### Guard Evaluation

Each intention also passes through a guard-based admissibility check:

{{< subfigure images="/images/quantification-intentions/collision_front_avoid/plots/guards.png,/images/quantification-intentions/collision_front_hit/plots/guards.png,/images/quantification-intentions/good/plots/guards.png" captions="Set A: all guards passed, Set B: guard failed (collision), Set C: all guards passed" >}}

- **Set A and C** are valid (all guards satisfied at all steps).
- **Set B** fails the collision guard and is rejected from final scoring.

| Set | Admissible | Lateral Accel Score | Speed Score | Final Score | Comments                           |
|-----|------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| A   | YES         | Low                 | Medium      | Medium       | Avoids obstacle but sharp turn     |
| B   | NO         | High                | High        | 0            | Smooth, but collision â†’ rejected   |
| C   | YES         | High                | High        | High         | Smooth, safe, fully admissible     |
