## Abstract

This work presents a JADE-based model for optimizing microgrid energy distribution. The proposed approach utilizes a multi-agent system framework to manage and control various distributed energy resources within a microgrid. By implementing intelligent agent behaviors, the system aims to enhance energy efficiency, reliability, and scalability in smart grid applications. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the JADE-based model in handling dynamic energy demands and supply conditions, contributing to the advancement of intelligent energy management systems.
