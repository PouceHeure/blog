## Abstract

Most demand-side management programs focus on the interactions between an aggregator and its users. Moreover, renewable energy production is irregular; increasing their number implies predicting consumption and managing energy storage or discharge in real time. Therefore, organizing the consumption patterns of every device connected to the grid is essential to optimize the global consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides valuable results that cannot be obtained in the real world due to time and cost constraints. This paper focuses on a multi-agent model to simulate a microgrid and domotics through automata and energy consumption scheduling.
