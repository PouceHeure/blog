## Abstract

In this paper, a non-haptic shared control is applied to navigate an intelligent vehicle based on two inputs: one by a human driver and the other by an autonomous system. The proposed shared decision-making model aims to improve the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicle navigation by integrating human intuition and machine precision. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in various driving scenarios. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
