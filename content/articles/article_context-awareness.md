## Abstract

Many studies faced the problem of vehicle autonomous navigation in different fields, but nowadays just a few of them uses all the implicit information coming from the context in which such navigation is occurring. This results in a huge potential information loss that prevents us from adapting the vehicle’s behavior to each different situation it may be in. In a previous work, we defined a method to model the static context of navigation using ontologies and take it into account in the command law when performing a local navigation task. In this paper, we extend our model of the context of navigation, and define a software architecture able to update the context dynamically, by using sensor information. The method is tested with real-time experiments on driving simulator. They show that the Context of Navigation can be effectively updated during the navigation and leads to a smarter vehicle’s behavior on the road.
