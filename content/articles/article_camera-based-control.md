## Abstract

By utilizing the camera installed in the front of a vehicle, this paper proposes on-board camera-based driving force control (CDFC) methods for autonomous electric vehicles driven by in-wheel motors. The image processing algorithm can detect the change in road surface conditions quickly and accurately. This enables the CDFC to update the slip-ratio limiter in real-time. Test results show that the proposed methods can improve traction control performance and reduce inverter input energy.
