## Abstract

This paper faces the problem of intelligent vehicles in interaction with their occupants and the environment, by modelling the semantic context associated with navigation. By semantically modelling context, an intelligent vehicle can not only drive itself safely but also reason about the situation and act accordingly. To achieve this, it is necessary to first define the Context of Navigation and then establish inference rules to enrich the vehicle's understanding of the situation. We propose a definition of the Context of Navigation, based on information pertinent to the vehicle's controller, dividing it into two components: the Dynamic Context and the Static Context. This paper focuses on the latter.
