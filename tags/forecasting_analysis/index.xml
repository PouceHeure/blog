&lt;p&gt;Determining the admissibility and quality of driving intentions, generated by an automated intelligent vehicle and by a human driver, is a sine qua none task in a human-intelligent vehicle share navigation. Our paper proposes a generic method to quantify driving intentions. These intentions are defined by a sequence of velocities. This formulation is based on metrics already discussed in the literature. It proposes a way to use them to evaluate a state, making a judgment, and to extend this evaluation to a sequence of states. This quantification determines whether the intention is safely achievable and defines a quality taking into account several criteria (safety, comfort, context, energy consumption). It is thus possible to compare and rank the intentions according to a set of criteria. This article defines a proposed implementation that has been tested on a driving simulator. For a given scenario, we tested our solution on several intentions in order to show the interest of our solution, and the possibility to compare the intentions between them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Isolated Areas Consumption Short-Term Forecasting Method</title><link>https://pouceheure.github.io/blog/articles/article_isolated-area-consumption/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pouceheure.github.io/blog/articles/article_isolated-area-consumption/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forecasting consumption in isolated areas represents a challenging problem typically resolved using deep learning or large mathematical models with various dimensions. These models require expertise in metering and algorithms, and the equipment needs to be frequently maintained. In the context of the MAESHA H2020 project, most of the consumers and producers are isolated. Forecasting becomes more difficult due to the lack of external data and the significant impact of human behaviors on these small systems. The proposed approach is based on data sequencing, sequential mining, and pattern mining to infer the results into a Hidden Markov Model. It only needs the consumption and production curve as a time series and adapts itself to provide the forecast. Our method gives a better forecast than other prediction machines and deep-learning methods used in the literature review.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
