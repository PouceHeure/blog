&lt;p&gt;My thesis is based on shared navigation between the autonomous system and the human. In our research, we focus on command fusion. In our approach, both entities, the human and the autonomous system, simultaneously control the vehicle, and a module acquires their commands and performs the command fusion. This approach involves studying the intentions of both the human and the autonomous system to ensure the most appropriate fusion of their choices and to evaluate the decision-making of each entity. The intention of the autonomous system is calculated using a visual servoing controller. The implementation of visual servoing relies on a deep learning network detecting lanes. For the human driver, who actively drives and cannot express their intention simultaneously, we use a deep learning-based model to predict their intention. The construction of this model required the creation of a driving dataset using our vehicles and the development of a recurrent model that integrates data of various types. Each of these intentions is then evaluated according to specific criteria, including safety, comfort, and context, to guide the fusion process towards the selection of the highest quality intention. This quantification is based on a state analysis derived from the realization of these intentions. We then use game theory to facilitate the fusion process, where each entity, human and autonomous system, aims to steer the final command towards their choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>General and Multi-Criteria Approach to Study the Admissibility and Quality of a Driving Intention</title><link>https://pouceheure.github.io/blog/articles/article_general-multi-criteria/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pouceheure.github.io/blog/articles/article_general-multi-criteria/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining the admissibility and quality of driving intentions, generated by an automated intelligent vehicle and by a human driver, is a sine qua none task in a human-intelligent vehicle share navigation. Our paper proposes a generic method to quantify driving intentions. These intentions are defined by a sequence of velocities. This formulation is based on metrics already discussed in the literature. It proposes a way to use them to evaluate a state, making a judgment, and to extend this evaluation to a sequence of states. This quantification determines whether the intention is safely achievable and defines a quality taking into account several criteria (safety, comfort, context, energy consumption). It is thus possible to compare and rank the intentions according to a set of criteria. This article defines a proposed implementation that has been tested on a driving simulator. For a given scenario, we tested our solution on several intentions in order to show the interest of our solution, and the possibility to compare the intentions between them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Context Awareness in Autonomous Navigation</title><link>https://pouceheure.github.io/blog/articles/article_context-awareness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pouceheure.github.io/blog/articles/article_context-awareness/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies faced the problem of vehicle autonomous navigation in different fields, but nowadays just a few of them uses all the implicit information coming from the context in which such navigation is occurring. This results in a huge potential information loss that prevents us from adapting the vehicle’s behavior to each different situation it may be in. In a previous work, we defined a method to model the static context of navigation using ontologies and take it into account in the command law when performing a local navigation task. In this paper, we extend our model of the context of navigation, and define a software architecture able to update the context dynamically, by using sensor information. The method is tested with real-time experiments on driving simulator. They show that the Context of Navigation can be effectively updated during the navigation and leads to a smarter vehicle’s behavior on the road.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Context Modelling Applied to the Intelligent Vehicle Navigation</title><link>https://pouceheure.github.io/blog/articles/article_context-modelling/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pouceheure.github.io/blog/articles/article_context-modelling/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper faces the problem of intelligent vehicles in interaction with their occupants and the environment, by modelling the semantic context associated with navigation. By semantically modelling context, an intelligent vehicle can not only drive itself safely but also reason about the situation and act accordingly. To achieve this, it is necessary to first define the Context of Navigation and then establish inference rules to enrich the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s understanding of the situation. We propose a definition of the Context of Navigation, based on information pertinent to the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s controller, dividing it into two components: the Dynamic Context and the Static Context. This paper focuses on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Shared Decision-Making Forward an Autonomous Navigation for Intelligent Vehicles</title><link>https://pouceheure.github.io/blog/articles/article_shared-decision/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pouceheure.github.io/blog/articles/article_shared-decision/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, a non-haptic shared control is applied to navigate an intelligent vehicle based on two inputs: one by a human driver and the other by an autonomous system. The proposed shared decision-making model aims to improve the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicle navigation by integrating human intuition and machine precision. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in various driving scenarios. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
